=================

Prototyping Tumblr's custom tab bar and custom views

**Time spent:** ~10 hrs

**Tasks completed:** All required, all optionals. I think I understand more of the stuff from Facebook last week and if I have time I'll redo last week's assignments. Took some time to figure out the animation of the png, but found UIImage.animatedImageNamed which did the trick. Wouldn't have been able to do that without help from classmates :). After finishing all the assignments and code clean up I wanted to try to replace the popover image with code. So I made the asset in PaintCode 2 and put it in a function. I wasn't able to animate it, so asked for help from a developer and he told me to make it a UIView class. You can now edit the text in the viewcontroller whih is pretty neat. Things are starting to make: sense.
